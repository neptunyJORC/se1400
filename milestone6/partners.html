                    <p>Ah, yes, XS Corp. The company that really knows how to make a deal... as long as it’s in their favor. We’ve partnered with them because they *are* there, and sometimes that's what you need, right?</p>
                    <p>Sure, their methods are a bit... unconventional, but who needs tradition when you’ve got a budget that barely makes sense? Working with XS Corp has been a ride, let’s just say that much.</p>
                    <p>They promise to help make our games run on devices that don't even exist yet, but hey, who’s asking questions about the "Omni-Box 0"? We’ll see how that works out in the long run.</p>
