                    <p>Ah, yes, XS Corp. The company that really knows how to make a deal... as long as it’s in their favor. We’ve partnered with them because they <i>are</i> there, and sometimes that's what you need, right?</p>
                    <p>Sure, their methods are a bit... unconventional, but who needs tradition when you’ve got a budget that barely makes sense? Working with XS Corp has been a ride, let’s just say that much.</p>
                    <p>They promise to help make our games run on devices that don't even exist yet, but hey, who’s asking questions about the "Omni-Box 0"? We’ll see how that works out in the long run.</p>

                    </a>
                    <p>Masochism Inc. – where things get... intense. They’re a company that, well, does things differently. If by differently you mean, <i>unbelievably intense</i>. We've partnered with them because, well... let's just say they offer something most wouldn’t.</p>
                    <p>Their methods? A little unorthodox. But, hey, sometimes it’s that special kind of 'edge' that makes our games more... exciting, right? When they said they could help with our user experience, they weren’t talking about a typical interface. No, no, they were talking about *challenges* you didn’t know you needed.</p>
                    <p>They’ve promised us tools that push the limits of creativity, but also... patience. And maybe a little sanity. We’ll see how far this goes, but I have a feeling they’re not going to go easy on us. But that’s... fine, right? We’re *totally* fine.</p>
