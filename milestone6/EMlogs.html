        First week here. The onboarding process was weird‚Äîvery clinical. No names, just ID numbers. No windows. They said it's standard procedure for "containment zones."

        Heard a sound coming from Sector 7 again. No one's assigned there. Security said to "ignore auditory anomalies." I'm starting to feel uneasy.

        Something is wrong. People I saw last week are gone. Their desks are empty‚Äîlike they were never here. I found a folder labeled <em>"EXHUMATION: Phase III."</em> I don't think this is a software company...

        They changed my ID badge without telling me. It now says ‚ÄúTier 2 Clearance‚Äù but I never applied for that. Since then, the lights outside my unit stay red. I don‚Äôt know what that means.

        The vending machine in Hallway C dispensed a small sealed envelope instead of chips. Inside was a note: <em>‚ÄúDo not trust her.‚Äù</em> There‚Äôs no one here by that name.

        There was an "Employee Wellness Broadcast" piped into my office today. Just static for 3 minutes, then a voice whispered, <em>"The walls remember."</em> Then silence.

        I passed out during my shift. Woke up with dried blood under my nails and a bandage on my neck. The med-bot said ‚ÄúRoutine sample extraction.‚Äù I never consented to anything.

        Someone left a journal on my desk. It‚Äôs written in my handwriting, but I don‚Äôt remember writing it. The last page just says: <em>‚ÄúYou were warned.‚Äù</em>
